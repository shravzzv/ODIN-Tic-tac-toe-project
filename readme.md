## Features

- **Winning Logic**: Implement a robust winning logic system that detects when a player has won the game by aligning three of their marks either horizontally, vertically, or diagonally.

- **Game Reset**: Provide a convenient option to reset the game board and start a new match, allowing players to continue playing without the need to refresh the page.

- **Game State Management**: Implement a module-based approach to manage the game state, making it easy to add features or enhancements in the future.
